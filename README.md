# **auto_proxychains**
*auto_proxychains* is an automated web scraping tool designed to collect up-to-date information from two websites using various proxy types, IP addresses, and ports. It includes four scripts (three in Python and one in Bash) that allow users to scrape data and activate proxy chains in Firefox (or any defined application) with a **single click**. This setup ensures both anonymity and access to the **most recent information available** on the sites.

auto_proxychains is an automated web scraping tool designed to streamline the process of gathering updated information from two different websites. using various proxy types (HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS5, SOCKS4). This project simplifies web scraping by enabling users to collect data with a single click.

## Features-
Multi-Proxy Support: Easily switch between different proxy types to optimize your scraping process.
Automated Scripts: Comprises four scripts (three in Python and one in Bash) that work together seamlessly.
One-Click Operation: Initiate scraping and activate proxy chains in Firefox with just a single command.
Efficient Data Retrieval: Continuously gather updated information from specified websites.

## Technologies-
Python: For writing the main scraping scripts.
Bash: To manage the automation process.

## Course of Action-
To execute the update_proxychains script, ensure that the required environment is set up. When run, **this script automatically invokes the three auxiliary scripts developed in Python**, which handle tasks such as retrieving the latest proxy lists, validating the proxies, and configuring them for use. This coordinated execution enables seamless updates to the proxy chains, ensuring that users can scrape data efficiently and securely from the target websites.
[Firefox: The preferred browser for proxy chaining.]

## Usage-
1. ### Download the Project
Clone the repository and install the required Python packages:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/auto_proxychains.git
cd auto_proxychains
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. ### Run the Bash Script
Start the scraping process and activate proxy chains by running:

./update_proxychains.sh
This command runs all necessary Python scripts and launches Firefox (or any configured application) with proxy chains, ensuring anonymous data collection.

## Features-
**Single-click execution**: The Bash script handles proxy activation and data scraping in one step.
**Automatic proxy updates**: Uses current proxy information to keep your browsing anonymous.
This tool is ideal for developers, researchers, and data analysts looking to automate web scraping tasks while maintaining anonymity through proxy servers.
